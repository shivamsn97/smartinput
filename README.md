# SmartInput
Much better implementation of the python input function, with hints and history support.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install smartinput.

```bash
pip install smartinput
```

Or alternatively, you can install the latest version using git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivamsn97/smartinput
cd smartinput
python setup.py install
```
## Usage

### Using Smart Input:
```python
from smartinput import sinput
mystr = input("Enter your name: ") #This parameter is optional
#This will work as a normal input function.

mystr2 = input("Enter your designation: ", hints=["teacher","student","developer","hobbyist"])
#This will show hints whenever user will input something.
```
#### You can further customize the input field:
```python
from smartinput import sinput, Fore
mystr = input("Name: ", hints=["Shivam", "Tushar", "Pulkit", "Imran"], color=Fore.BLUE, hintcolor=Fore.GREEN)
```
#### Input History
Yes. You heard it right. sinput supports History. Which means you can be able to arrow keys to navigate to previously used inputs. By default, previously used history is also treated as hints, and current input is automatically added to the provided History object. 
```python
from smartinput import sinput, History, Fore
myhistory = History()
str1 = input(">> ", history=myhistorymyhistory, color=Fore.BLUE)
str2 = input(">> ", history=myhistorymyhistory, color=Fore.BLUE)
str3 = input(">> ", history=myhistorymyhistory, color=Fore.BLUE)
str4 = input(">> ", history=myhistorymyhistory, color=Fore.BLUE)
#You can use up and down arrow keys to navigate to history. Also, history will be shown as hints.

str5 = input(">> ", history=myhistorymyhistory, historyAsHints=False, color=Fore.BLUE)
#Here, history will not be considered as hints.

str6 = input(">> ", history=myhistorymyhistory,autohistory=False, color=Fore.BLUE)
#The input of this command will not be added to history automatically.
```

### Create a Shell 
You can create a fully interactive shell using smartinput, in just a few lines.

#### Making a callback function
To create a shell, you must have a function that accepts two positional parameters, first is the input provided by the user, and second is a instance of a class that will be used to interact with shell in runtime.
```python
def handle_query(query, shell):
    shell.out("You said: " + query) #This will output the first parameter on the shell.
    #TODO:  in future versions, you will also be able to use return in place of shell.out.
```

You can also exit from the shell using shell.exit()
```python
def handle_query(query, shell):
    if("bye" in query):
        shell.exit()  #will exit the shell when the input is bye.
    shell.out("You said: " + query) #This will output the first parameter on the shell.
```

Alert message (Something like *Please Wait...*)
It automatically disappears on next alert or output.
```python
from time import sleep

def handle_query(query, shell):
    shell.alert("Please wait. Thinking...")
    sleep(3)  #Do processing here.
    if("bye" in query):
        shell.exit()  #will exit the shell when the input is bye.
    shell.out("You said: " + query) 
```

#### Making our Shell
```python
from smartinput import Shell, Fore
myshell = Shell()
#Important:
myshell.setcallback(handle_query) #handle_query function was defined in the above section

#Optional:
myshell.intitle("Input: ") #defaults to "> "
myshell.outtitle("Output: ") #defaults to "< "
myshell.setinputcolor(Fore.BLUE)
myshell.setoutputcolor(Fore.GREEN)
myshell.setalertcolor(Fore.RED)  # Color for the alert messsage.
myshell.setexiton("quit") #defaults to "exit". Whenever user inputes this or press ctrl+d (EOF, linux), the shell exits.

#You can also pass all these in the Shell constructor:
#myshell = Shell(callback=handle_query, intitle="Input: ", outtitle="Output: ", inputcolor=Fore.BLUE, outputcolor=Fore.GREEN, alertcolor=Fore.RED, exiton="quit")

#Start the shell using:
myshell.start()
```
